When patients book via phone or text, appointments are instantly created in Cliniko with correct appointment types, practitioners, and locations. Changes made in Cliniko (like cancellations or reschedules) automatically update the AI system. This bidirectional sync ensures your team always has accurate information without manual data entry. Learn more about our <a href="/cliniko-ai-booking-system" class="text-green-600 underline">Cliniko AI booking integration</a>.'},{question:"Can AI handle NDIS participant bookings and plan management?",answer:"Yes, our AI tracks NDIS participant plan budgets, service agreements, and funding categories. When participants book, the system verifies funding availability, allocates costs to correct line items, and warns when plans are nearing limits. It automatically generates NDIS reporting for service agreements, plan utilization, and participant outcomes. The system handles both plan-managed and self-managed participants, ensuring compliance with NDIS pricing and service delivery requirements."},{question:"How does AI reduce appointment no-shows?",answer:"AI sends personalized reminders via SMS, email, and phone calls at optimal times (48 hours, 24 hours, and 2 hours before appointments). Patients can confirm, reschedule, or cancel with simple responses, which automatically updates Cliniko. The system detects patterns of high-risk no-shows and increases reminder frequency. For chronic no-show patients, it offers easy rescheduling options. Practices typically see 50-70% reduction in no-shows within the first month."},{question:"Can AI deliver exercise programs and track patient compliance?",answer:"Absolutely. After treatment, practitioners flag patients for exercise programs in Cliniko. AI automatically sends personalized programs via text or email with video demonstrations, written instructions, and tracking links. Patients receive daily or weekly reminders to complete exercises and can log progress. Practitioners see compliance dashboards showing which patients are adhering to programs and which need follow-up. This improves outcomes by 40-60% compared to paper handouts."},{question:"How does AI handle multi-practitioner scheduling?",answer:"AI learns each practitioner's schedule, skills, appointment types, and preferences from Cliniko. When patients book, it intelligently matches them to available practitioners based on treatment type, location, insurance requirements, and patient preferences. It prevents double-bookings, manages room conflicts, and optimizes appointment sequencing. For group classes or multi-practitioner treatments, it coordinates schedules across multiple calendars automatically."},{question:"Can AI handle WorkCover and TAC claims?",answer:"Yes, AI tracks WorkCover and TAC patients, ensuring correct claim codes, employer details, and treatment authorizations are captured during booking. It monitors claim limits, alerts when pre-approvals are needed, and generates required documentation. The system integrates with Cliniko to tag appointments correctly and produces reports for insurance claim submission. This reduces claim rejections by 70-80% and speeds up payment processing."},{question:"Does AI support health fund claiming and rebates?",answer:"AI captures patient health fund details during booking, verifies coverage for specific treatment types, and checks annual limits or gap payments. It integrates with HICAPS for instant claiming where available, or generates claim forms for manual submission. Patients receive automatic reminders about rebate eligibility and claim status. This reduces reception time on fund queries by 60-70% while improving patient satisfaction."},{question:"Can patients book group classes or workshops via AI?",answer:"Yes, AI handles group bookings for pilates classes, rehab programs, or educational workshops. It manages class capacity, waitlists, and automatic confirmations. Patients can view available class times, book recurring sessions, and receive class-specific reminders. The system syncs with Cliniko group appointments and handles cancellations with automatic waitlist promotion. This automation increases class attendance by 30-40%."},{question:"How does AI handle complex scheduling rules?",answer:'AI learns your practice rules: appointment durations by treatment type, buffer times between patients, equipment requirements, practitioner qualifications, and location-specific constraints. It enforces these automatically when booking, preventing scheduling errors. You can set rules like "knee reconstructions need 60 minutes with senior physios" or "podiatry diabetic assessments require specific equipment rooms." The system ensures compliance 100% of the time without staff intervention.'},{question:"What ROI can allied health practices expect?",answer:"Practices typically see: 50-70% reduction in no-shows (average $2,000-5,000/month recovered revenue), 15-20 hours/week admin time saved ($15,000-25,000/year), 20-30% increase in appointment capacity without additional staff, 40-60% improvement in exercise program compliance (better outcomes and reviews), and 30-40% reduction in phone interruptions. Most practices achieve positive ROI within 3-6 months, with solo practices saving $20,000-35,000/year and multi-practitioner clinics saving $50,000-100,000/year."},{question:"Can AI handle emergency or urgent bookings?",answer:"Yes, AI recognizes urgent keywords (acute pain, injury, emergency) and automatically checks for same-day or next-day appointments across all practitioners. It can bump less urgent appointments if configured, notify practitioners of urgent cases, and escalate to reception if no slots are available. For practices offering urgent care pathways, AI ensures these patients get priority scheduling while maintaining normal booking flow for routine appointments."},{question:"How does AI support AHPRA compliance and clinical governance?",answer:"AI maintains complete audit trails of all patient communications, bookings, and consent processes. It ensures patients are informed of practitioner qualifications, treatment risks, and cancellation policies. The system tracks continuing education requirements for practitioners, manages scope of practice boundaries, and alerts to potential clinical governance issues. All data is stored in Australian servers with encryption meeting AHPRA privacy requirements."},{question:"Can AI handle waitlist management?",answer:"Yes, AI automatically adds patients to waitlists when preferred times aren't available, monitors for cancellations, and contacts waitlisted patients immediately when slots open. It prioritizes based on urgency, booking date, or clinical priority. Patients can join waitlists via phone, text, or online, and receive updates on their position. This reduces waitlist coordination time by 80-90% and ensures optimal appointment utilization."},{question:"How long does implementation take?",answer:"Implementation follows a 9-14 week timeline: 2-3 weeks for Cliniko integration assessment and configuration, 3-5 weeks for core AI deployment including booking system and reminders, and 4-6 weeks for advanced features like exercise delivery and NDIS management. The phased approach ensures minimal disruption to existing workflows while allowing staff to adapt gradually. Most practices are fully operational with core features within 5-8 weeks."},{question:"What ongoing support is provided?",answer:"We provide 24/7 technical support for critical issues (booking system down), regular system updates and Cliniko sync maintenance, monthly performance reviews showing no-show rates and booking patterns, quarterly optimization sessions to improve AI responses, compliance monitoring for NDIS/AHPRA requirements, continuous AI training with new scenarios, and dedicated account management. Our team includes allied health specialists who understand physiotherapy, chiropractic, and podiatry workflows and proactively suggest improvements based on industry best practices."}],P=[{icon:r,title:"Cliniko Native Integration",description:'Seamlessly syncs with Cliniko for real-time appointment management, patient records, and practitioner schedules.
