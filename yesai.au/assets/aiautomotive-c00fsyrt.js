It schedules test drives, answers financing questions, follows up with prospects automatically, and identifies hot buyers for immediate sales team attention. Dealerships typically see 30-50% increase in qualified leads and 20-35% improvement in conversion rates."},{question:"Can AI integrate with our dealer management system (DMS)?",answer:"Yes, our AI solutions integrate with major DMS platforms including CDK Global, Reynolds & Reynolds, DealerTrack, Auto/Mate, and others. We connect via APIs to sync customer data, vehicle inventory, service history, and appointments in real-time, ensuring seamless operations without duplicate data entry across systems."},{question:"Will AI replace our sales and service staff?",answer:"No, AI enhances their effectiveness rather than replacing them. AI handles initial inquiries, appointment scheduling, follow-ups, and routine questions, freeing sales and service staff to focus on high-value activities like building relationships, closing deals, and providing expert advice. Staff report being able to serve 2-3x more customers effectively with AI support."},{question:"How does AI improve service department efficiency?",answer:"AI answers service inquiries instantly, books appointments based on technician availability and job type, sends automated service reminders based on mileage and time, provides repair estimates, handles parts inquiries, follows up after service visits, and identifies upsell opportunities. Service departments typically see 30-40% increase in bookings and 25-35% improvement in customer retention."},{question:"Can AI help with test drive scheduling and follow-up?",answer:"Yes, AI checks sales team availability, suggests suitable times based on customer preferences, sends confirmations and reminders with directions and required documents, follows up if customers don't show, and reschedules automatically. After test drives, it sends thank you messages and provides next steps. This reduces no-shows by 40-60% and ensures every prospect receives timely follow-up."},{question:"How does AI qualify automotive leads?",answer:"AI engages prospects in natural conversation to understand vehicle preferences, budget, trade-in details, financing needs, and purchase timeline. It scores leads based on buying signals, categorizes them (hot/warm/cold), and routes qualified buyers to sales staff with detailed notes. This ensures sales teams spend time on prospects most likely to purchase, improving close rates by 20-35%."},{question:"What ROI can automotive dealerships expect?",answer:"Dealerships typically see 30-50% increase in qualified leads, 20-35% improvement in sales conversion, 30-40% increase in service bookings, 25-40% reduction in lead response time, 40-60% improvement in follow-up consistency, and sales/service staff handling 2-3x more customers. Most dealerships achieve positive ROI within 4-8 months."},{question:"How does AI support financing and trade-in inquiries?",answer:"AI provides preliminary financing estimates based on customer information, explains financing options and terms, collects pre-qualification details for finance managers, answers common financing questions, gathers trade-in vehicle details and condition, provides estimated trade-in values, and schedules in-person trade-in appraisals. This streamlines the process and sets proper expectations before customers visit."},{question:"Can AI send service reminders and maintenance alerts?",answer:"Yes, AI monitors service history and automatically sends personalized reminders for oil changes, tire rotations, inspections, and scheduled maintenance based on mileage and time intervals. It includes relevant service specials, makes booking easy with one-click scheduling, and follows up on declined services. This increases service retention by 30-50% and ensures customer vehicles are properly maintained."},{question:"How does AI handle after-hours inquiries?",answer:"AI provides full sales and service support 24/7, answering questions about vehicles, pricing, features, financing, and service. It captures leads, books appointments, and provides information when dealership is closed. When dealership opens, staff receive summaries of all after-hours interactions with qualified leads ready for immediate follow-up. This prevents loss of leads to competitors who might respond faster."},{question:"What about customer data privacy and security?",answer:"Customer data is encrypted, stored securely in Australian data centers, and handled in accordance with Australian Privacy Principles and automotive industry regulations. Access is role-based and logged. Customers can request their data at any time. We never sell customer data or share it with third parties beyond the dealership's authorized systems."},{question:"How does AI support parts department operations?",answer:"AI answers parts availability inquiries instantly, provides pricing and specifications, orders parts from suppliers automatically based on inventory levels, notifies customers when parts arrive, schedules installation appointments, handles warranty claims processing, and tracks parts usage for inventory optimization. This reduces parts counter staff workload by 40-60% while improving service speed."},{question:"How long does implementation take for a dealership?",answer:"Implementation follows a 12-17 week timeline: 2-3 weeks for discovery and DMS integration planning, 4-6 weeks for core AI deployment including sales and service support, and 6-8 weeks for advanced features like predictive maintenance and retention automation. Dealerships see immediate benefits from lead capture while gradually expanding AI capabilities across departments."},{question:"What training is required for dealership staff?",answer:"Training is practical and role-based: sales staff receive 2-3 hours on lead handoff and system features, service advisors get 2-3 hours on appointment management and customer communication, parts staff receive 2 hours on inventory integration, and managers get 3-4 hours on analytics and optimization. Most staff become proficient within their first week of use."},{question:"What ongoing support do you provide?",answer:"We provide 24/7 technical support for critical issues, regular system updates trained on automotive conversations, monthly performance reviews with optimization recommendations, quarterly strategy sessions, industry-specific customizations, dedicated account management, and proactive monitoring.
