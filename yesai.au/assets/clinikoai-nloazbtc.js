It answers calls 24/7, books appointments in real-time by checking actual practitioner availability, and manages patient records automatically—all through natural voice conversations."},{question:"Can AI really book appointments directly in Cliniko?",answer:"Yes. Using Cliniko's robust API, our AI voice assistant checks real-time availability across all your practitioners and locations, creates appointments with the correct appointment type (Initial Consultation, Standard Review, Group Class, etc.), adds detailed appointment notes including reason for booking and funding information, and can even create or update patient records when needed—all during a single phone call."},{question:"Is Cliniko AI integration suitable for my practice type?",answer:"Cliniko AI integration is ideal for allied health practices including physiotherapy, chiropractic, psychology, massage therapy, exercise physiology, podiatry, speech pathology, occupational therapy, and similar healthcare specialties. The system can be configured to handle your specific appointment types, funding arrangements (DVA, HCP, CHSP, private), multi-location setups, and unique booking rules."},{question:"How long does implementation take?",answer:"Most implementations are completed within 3-4 weeks from kickoff to pilot go-live. This includes API integration setup, voice AI configuration, custom script development tailored to your practice, comprehensive testing, and staff training. The pilot typically begins with after-hours coverage, then expands to business-hours overflow once KPIs are stable."},{question:"What happens if the AI can't handle a call?",answer:"The system includes intelligent escalation pathways. Complex queries, complaints, clinical questions, or situations requiring human judgment are routed to your team. During business hours, this can be a live handoff with full context. After hours, the AI captures details and sends an email summary for follow-up. The AI never attempts to handle matters beyond its capabilities."},{question:"How does the AI identify returning patients?",answer:"The system uses multiple identification methods in sequence: first, it attempts to match the caller's phone number against existing Cliniko patient records. If no match is found, it asks for the patient's name and location (suburb or village). Date of birth can be used as a fallback verification method. For new patients, a complete profile is created during the call."},{question:"Does the AI handle different funding types (DVA, HCP, Medicare)?",answer:"Yes. The AI is trained to understand Australian healthcare funding arrangements including DVA (Department of Veterans' Affairs), Home Care Packages (HCP), Commonwealth Home Support Programme (CHSP), GP Medicare referrals, and private health insurance. It captures relevant details, notes them on appointments, and can route funding queries to your accounts team."},{question:"Is my patient data secure?",answer:"Absolutely. We implement least-privilege API access (only requesting permissions we actually need), TLS encryption for all data in transit, AES-256 encryption for data at rest, complete audit logging of all interactions, and compliance with Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). All data is handled according to healthcare-appropriate security standards."},{question:"Can I start with a limited pilot before full deployment?",answer:"Yes, we recommend it. Most practices start with after-hours coverage (evenings, weekends, public holidays)—capturing calls that would otherwise go to voicemail. This allows you to evaluate AI performance with real patient interactions before expanding to business-hours overflow. There's no commitment to scale until you're confident in the system."},{question:"What phone number will patients call?",answer:"We provision a new Australian 02 (or your preferred area code) business number for your practice. This can work alongside your existing numbers during transition—calls can divert to the AI after a set number of rings, during specific hours, or when your existing line is busy. Once stable, you can choose to make the AI number your primary published number."}],q=[{number:1,title:"Patient Calls",description:"AI answers immediately with a warm, professional greeting"},{number:2,title:"Identity Match",description:"Caller matched to Cliniko record or new profile created"},{number:3,title:"Intent Understood",description:"AI determines booking, reschedule, FAQ, or other request"},{number:4,title:"Action Completed",description:"Appointment booked in Cliniko with notes; confirmation sent"}],H=i(P.map(e=>({question:e.question,answer:e.answer}))),T=a({name:"Cliniko AI Booking System",description:"AI-powered voice receptionist that integrates directly with Cliniko practice management software.
